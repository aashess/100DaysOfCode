# Day 13 of 100DaysofCode

Feeling excited to start Day 13th of 100 DaysOfCode, as I started prety Late to code. So today I have a lot of pending tasks. As well as have to document
all of that learning like this. Today I learnt about Debugging.

I learnt through Angela Yuin Course From Udemy. 100DaysOfPython. 
Now I will start documenting like this Each and every day. 
Today, Session includes Spot the Bug, Reproducing the Bug in Python language. as well as also applied this in real world project.

## Describe_the_Problem
First Make sure that You identify the Problem. Where actually problem is creating in the code. 

## Reproduce_the_Bug 
Try to find out where the Bug is actually occuring in the problem. 

## Play_Computer
Try to act like Computer. Think like Computer, try to think each and every step like Computer. How actually computer will think and execute at this moment. There after you can easily able to identify the bug. 

## Fix_the_Error
Try to fix the error, think like where did problem is occuring and try to fix that. 

## Print_is_your_friend
Try to use print statement so that you can able to spot on where is the actual problem is occuring in that code base. 
     
## Use_a_debbugger
You can able to use different form of debbugger in order to find the bug, as it won't show the actual bug but it can able to spot on how does the control is following in the code base as in that order you can able to find out the bug in which line that is occured. 

## Take_a_Break 
You can easily take your mind game another level, just by taking simple break and taking sleep. Your sleep plays an important role in that process.

## Ask_Your_Friend
When You really got stuck somewhere than In that phase asking any of your friend would be a nice idea. The best thing about asking your friend is that by looking at your code base they don't see as a same assumptions as you did. So they have some fresh eye while helping you. And Next time you can offer them the same help. This is all collaborating sorts of domain. You can't go alone.  
## Run_Often
Run your program often, Don't wait for your whole code to be written well and perfect and then run your code NO, That is all bad idea of executing your code. Try to run your code more often, as you make a simple code changes try to run and be confirm with your changes. If you leave it all for end then you end up having lots of bug and can't able to decide where to start. 
     
## Ask_StackOverflow 
This is one of the last sorts of option left with any developer as when you can't able to fix your bug, then try to come over stackoverflow and then search for your problem, maybe someone else had already answered those sorts of problem, they may faced it before.  

Everyone Gets Bug---If you are getting bug it means you are really exciling. Remember
